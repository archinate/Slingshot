Slingshot! for Grasshopper
=========

Slingshot! for Grasshopper exposes components for use with the Grasshopper plug-in for Rhino.  Slingshot! components enable users to access, modify, query, and create relational databases from within Grasshopper using interfaces such as MySQL, ODBC, and SQLite.  

Originally, Slingshot! was first released in April 2011 as a free plug-in for Grasshopper.  I am happy to now offer Slingshot! as an Open Source project in the hope that the concepts introduced by this plug-in will be expanded upon by collaborators and also inform the work of other projects in the Computational Design community.

Enjoy the source! -Nate
