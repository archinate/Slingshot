Slingshot has Moved to BitBucket.org!

Slingshot! for Grasshopper exposes components for use with the Grasshopper plug-in for Rhino.  Slingshot! components enable users to access, modify, query, and create relational databases from within Grasshopper using interfaces such as MySQL, ODBC, and SQLite.  

Originally, Slingshot! was first released in April 2011 as a free plug-in for Grasshopper.  I am happy to now offer Slingshot! as an Open Source Visual Studio 2012 project. My hope is that the concepts introduced by this plug-in will be expanded upon by collaborators and will also inform the work of other projects in the Computational Design community.

Enjoy the source! -Nate
